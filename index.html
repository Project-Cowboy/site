<h1>Cowboy: zkTLS for Cardano</h1>
<div class="section">
<h2>What is Cowboy?</h2>
<p>Cowboy is a decentralized protocol that can verify arbitrary web data while preserving privacy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Web3 dapps need access to web data. Web3 apps require data from Web2&mdash;prices, posts, records&mdash;but can't trust it blindly. Cowboy uses <strong>TLSNotary</strong>-style verification to prove HTTPS sessions occurred, and offers selective redaction so only the necessary data is revealed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2>How it works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cowboy runs as a partnerchain that verifies TLSNotary data. As a partnerchain, it can do so optimally and configurably.</li>
<li>A decentralized notary set verifies zkTLS proofs.</li>
<li>Verified data is represented on-chain in some form.</li>
<li>Other apps or decentralized environments can reference verified Web2 facts.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>Developer Example</h2>
<p>Imagine a state website that provides access to a citizen-only portal. A zkTLS proof of authentication to this page can prove the user's unique citizenship. The user proves it privately, producing an on-chain credential that does not reveal their identity, but can be used in other dapps or off-chain applications.</p>
<p>Apply the same capability shown above to particular public or private web sources. TikTok, X, games, media, and you get an intuition of how the tool can be applied.</p>
